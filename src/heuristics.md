# Heuristics

## Differences in Capabilities of Heuristic Scanning in Microsoft Defender with and without Cloud Protection

### With Cloud Protection Turned On:
- **Enhanced Detection:** Cloud protection leverages Microsoft's vast cloud infrastructure to provide near-instant detection and blocking of new and emerging threats. This means that heuristic scanning can benefit from real-time updates and advanced machine learning models that are continuously updated in the cloud.
- **Behavior Analysis:** The cloud can analyze suspicious behavior and patterns more effectively, providing a higher level of protection against sophisticated threats.
- **Faster Response:** Cloud protection allows for quicker response times to new threats, as the cloud can process and analyze data much faster than local systems.

### Without Cloud Protection Turned On:
- **Local Heuristics:** Heuristic scanning relies solely on the local database and predefined rules. This means it may not be as effective in detecting the latest threats that have not yet been added to the local database.
- **Limited Updates:** Without cloud protection, updates to heuristic scanning capabilities are limited to periodic updates rather than real-time enhancements.
- **Slower Detection:** The detection and response times may be slower, as the local system has to process and analyze threats without the additional computational power and data available in the cloud.

### Summary
Enabling cloud protection significantly enhances the heuristic scanning capabilities of Microsoft Defender by providing real-time updates, advanced behavior analysis, and faster response times.
