Welcome to the **"Threathunting Academy - Evasion"**  this is the official lab guide that will guide you through the infrastructure. Students will all have their own **Windows 10 client machine**, a shared central `Domain Controller` and a **Kali** `Red Team server and Forensics machine`. All logs are centrally collected on and Ubuntu server running Elasticsearch and Kibana.

**What you will learn in this training:**

- How attack frameworks work
- AV and EDR internals and how to evade them
  - Windows Defender, AMSI and ETW basics and evasion
- Powershell based attacks (in-mempry) 
- How signature based detection works and how to evade
- What Shellcode is, how to build and use shellcode
- Build your own evasive shellcode loader
- Build your own Forensics Lab

> In this training we'll be using an ***Adminstrator*** account, this training is not about privilege escalation, but to show you how you can elevate a regular user to an Admin/System user, we'll have a brief lab doing just that.

With that out of the way we'll run all other labs with and admin user.
